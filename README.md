<h3 align="center">What is it?</h3>
  <p align="center">
    Spread is a fullbody, zombie, survival game in early development.
    Big game being made by single person might sound like a really bad game, but previous experiences taught me to take thing slow and focus on details.
    Spread and its 2 previos version are a big lesson for me, letting me expand my skills with practical approach and gain experience.
