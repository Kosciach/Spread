# Spread

Spread is my dream game—something I’ve been building on and off in my spare time for years, even though I know I might never finish it.
It began back when I was new to Unity and wanted to merge my favorite features from different games into one. Since then, I’ve scrapped and restarted it multiple times, each version helping me level up my skills and explore new design approaches.
Right now, I’m working on polishing the ladder climbing system using IK.
